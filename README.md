# Foads Fun Fusion
A hub where I will share my data science ideas and games ranging from small to complex ones.

## Motivation
This is a hobby project. I am not a full-stack developer but mainly a Python and C++ developer. However, I am interested in learning new languages and love packaging data science into a visual presentation many can consume. This allows me to convert all my local Python simulations, games, and statistics into interactive web experiences. Hopefully, you learn something new and exciting.

## Website?
A future website/link will soon come up when I have my first project ready.

## Any suggestions?
Feel free to create an issue labeled with the suggestion/idea!
